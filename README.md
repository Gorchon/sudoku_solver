sudoku solver


I had the opportunity to work on a Sudoku solver in Python, implementing backtracking algorithms. The solver delivered rapid solutions and featured a user-friendly interface with screenshot analysis integration. This project allowed me to improve my algorithmic skills and problem-solving creativity.
